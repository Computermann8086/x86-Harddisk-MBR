# x86 Harddisk MBR
This is a 134 byte long MBR, Master Boot Record, for harddisks on the IBM PC and it's compatibles. It's written entirely in 8086 assembly, and has extensive commenting. 
It's based on the 139 byte long Standard MBR by Microsoft Corp. written in 1988 for use by MS-DOS 3.30 trough Windows 95a.
It's completely compatible with FDISK from MS-DOS.
I'm hoping that it will be useful for someone.
